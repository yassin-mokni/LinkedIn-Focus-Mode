## Introduction

LinkedIn Focus Mode is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle your personal information and data when you use our extension.

## Data Collection

We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or data from users. The extension operates entirely within your browser and only interacts with the LinkedIn website to provide its functionality.

## Permissions

The permissions requested by the extension (`webNavigation`, `tabs`, `storage`, and `*://www.linkedin.com/*`) are solely for the purpose of modifying the LinkedIn interface and ensuring the extension functions correctly. These permissions do not involve the collection or transmission of user data.

## Local Storage

The extension uses Chrome's `storage.sync` API to store user preferences such as whether the extension is enabled and the user's chosen CTA destination. This data is stored locally within your browser and is not transmitted to any external servers.

## User Control

Users have full control over the extension's settings and can enable or disable the extension at any time. The extension's functionality is transparent, and users can see the changes it makes to the LinkedIn interface.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the extension's description or provided as an update to the extension.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us.
